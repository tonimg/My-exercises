//a) Do a simple function for show the names of the properties.



console.log(something, somethingMore, somethingMoreAndMore)
//name, class, id
b) Now, do a simple function for show the content of those properties.

console.log(somethingThatShowsThings) //Tony, VII, 01
c) So, we can change a property value? Change the class to "XI".

console.log(property.ThisProperty) //new value
d) Now, delete the id property.

console.log(property.ThisProperty) //Not exist :(
e) Add a new property called city and give some value

e1) Asure the changes showing the property in console.

console.log(city) // New York City
f) List the number of properties we have now on objects.

console.log() // There are 4 info fields
g) Change the property name to fullName

g1) Asure the changes.

console.log(fullName) // Tony Stark
h) For last, add a presentation message like: "Hello, my name is " + ..., and show all values of the object.

console.log(...) // "Hi there, I'm Tony Stark..."
h1) Add some properties more...like job, Studies and Marks average

h2) Asure the changes and show for console.

console.log(location) // NYC
i) Make a constructor object called avenger and pass the info, creating a instance of the object with the properties of our created object

Example:

function avenger(fullName, class, city, job, studies,markAv) {
    this.fullName = fullName;
    this.class = class;
    this.city = city;
    this.job= job;
    this.studies= studies;
    this.markAv = markAv;
}
var tonyStark = new person ("Tony Stark", "XI", "NYC", "Ingeneer", "MIT", 10)
console.log(tonyStark)
j) Create other avenger and print the name for console

var otherAvenger = new Avenger...
console.log(otherAvenger) // Hulk...
k) Now create one property of object that print a pretty description of avengers.

console.log(otherAvenger.somethingThatShows) // Hulk, 30...
l) Now, make a function that only shows the NAMES of created avengers.

console.log(someFunction) // Tony Stark, Hulk, Thor...
m) Make other student and prepare for ONLY show the names, the age and location.

console.log(propertyValues) // my name, my age and my location!
